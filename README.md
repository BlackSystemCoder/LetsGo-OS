# Let's Go OS

This is a little experiment I did for myself where I tried to make an OS in the 
Go programming language. 

## Goal

The goal is not to create a "fully" functional operating system (whatever this means) 
but I only want to implement a FAT32-filesystem and use that. I did one once but I
cannot continue working on that one and doing it for Linux is too easy so I wrote my own
OS for this. Also for a long time I wanted to start learning Go.

## Why Go?

Go is not really ment to be used as an operating system programming language, I'm
aware of that. But even though it is not ment to be it is still possible. So why not 
do it? I just did not want to use C. The alternative would have been Rust but this
is more interesting.
